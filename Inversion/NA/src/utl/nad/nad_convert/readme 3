	Programs rfi2nad and nad2rfi convert to and from an ascii
	file containing models output by the receiver function inversion
	to a Neighbourhood Algorithm Direct access file (nad). This
	direct access file is used as the default input format to
	program NAB (Neighbourhood Algorithm Bayesian Inference)

	Direct access files are faster to read and more compact.

	Both programs act as examples of how to call the subroutines
	read_nad and write_nad which read and write nad files. These
	routines can be used to build other programs for converting
	between nad and other ascii model file formats. 

Compile with

        make rfi2nad nad2rfi

        executables are placed in Demo/bin directory


To convert from and asci rfi file to a nad file 
 
                         rfi2nad file.in file.out
        where,
             `file.in'  = input rfi file (e.g. `NAV22.mdl')
             `file.out' = output direct access `*.nad' file (e.g. `NAV22.nad')


To convert from a direct access nad file to an ascii rfi file 
 
 			 nad2rfi file.in file.out 
 
 	where 
 	     `file.in'  = input direct access `*.nad' file (e.g. `NAV22.nad')
 	     `file.out' = output ascii rfi file
