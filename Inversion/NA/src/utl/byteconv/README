sacsun2dec writes a byte-swaped little endian SAC file 
from a big endian SAC file. 
This byte-conversion program should be run on a little endian machine, 
such as DEC alpha. 

1. compile
make sacsun2dec

2. usage
sacsun2dec (SUN_SAC_file)

The big endian SUN_SAC_file will be replaced by its byte-swaped 
little endian SAC file. 

A shell script sun2dec can be used to convert several SAC files.
